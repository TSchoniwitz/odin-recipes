    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for lavender cookies. These cookies go great with a cup of tea or coffee. Using lavender infused simple syrup, these cookies have a gentle lavender flavor that doesn't taste like you're just eating a flower.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cups butter</li>
      <li>1 cup lavender infused simple syrup (more on this later)</li>
      <li>2 cups flour</li>
      <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Icing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>2-3 Tbsp water</li>
      <li>1 tsp lavender infused simple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375F. Grease two lined baking sheets.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, mix eggs, butter, and lavender syrup together until well incorporated.</li>
      <li>In another large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Pour the wet ingredients in to the dry, and mix together well. Drop golfball sized pieces of dough onto the greased baking sheet, leaving a little room for spreading.</li>
      <li>Bake cookies for 10-15 minutes, until edges are golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
      <li>In a bowl combine powdered sugar, water, and lavender syrup until it forms a smooth frosting. If it's too thick, add more water or lavender syrup. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar. Once you get the desired consistency, spread a thin layer onto the cooled cookies. Garnish with a few dried lavender buds if you'd like.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>About lavender infused simple syrup. You can make a simple syrup by dissolving sugar in hot water. A 1 to 1 ratio of sugar to water works well. Once the sugar is completely dissolved, you can either put the dried lavender buds directly into the simple syrup and let it infuse for at least 24 hours, and then strain it out. Or you can make a small lavender sachet using cheesecloth and butchers twine, and put that into the simply syrup.</p>
