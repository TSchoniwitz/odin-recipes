This project is to create an online recipe website. I'm gonna be utilizing what I've learned so far in HTML, git, and github. Writing HTML code to include headers, paragraphs, images, and links. Using git to stage, commit, and push progress to github. Not too concerned with making this website look nice, but focusing on getting the code right and getting the flow of using git and github.
